<h1>VHF Radio Options</h1>

<a href="index.html">Return To Homepage</a>

<p>It is popular that a boat has both a primary and a secondary VHF radio 
however this is less critical on smaller craft that simply don't have the 
batteries for this as well as being unable to venture out quite as far. Since I 
have decided to keep with the Raymarine GPM400 Helm Setup I would like to choose 
a period accurate and stylistically cohesive VHF radio choice to keep with the 
vintage look. I also have a sneaky suspicion that the electronics from this era 
were of better quality.</p>
