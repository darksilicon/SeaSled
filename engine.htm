<img border="0" src="images/vf90sideview.png" width="164" height="300" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">The design plans for the Sea-Jet were designed for outboard power. probably 
for simplicity. They specify 90hp as the design maximum and based on the 
previous builds that i have seen this about correct for a boat that can travel 
at 45mph. This is more than fast enough for a cruiser and should easily allow 
the boat to get out of the way of any sort of weather.</p>

<p>So I think that this is probably the best 90hp motor on the market</p>
<p>SDS </p>
<p>Quiet (important in a cruiser)</p>
<p>The 
build plans specify a 90hp outboard as the largest that should be fitted to this 
design.</p>
<p>Yamaha makes a V-Max SHO 90 H.P. Outboard at 365 pounds that should do 
nicely. The concern is that the Yamaha will be highly aerated at the stern of 
the sea sled.</p>
<p>Due to costs and needing to prove the design I may do the initial runs with a 
trolling motor or a small gasoline outboard motor.</p>
<p>I haven't made a lot of plans in this area primarily because I need to get 
the thing built first.</p>
<p>They have sample boats on Yamaha's website and I would think that the Sea-Jet 
should be able to do at least 45 MPH if trimmed properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Budget Options</h3>
<p>If when I initially get the boat in the water I don't have the budget for 12K 
motor plus rigging I might opt for a sail drive motor temporarily to do the sea 
trials. These provide higher thrust and will fit on the same size transom.</p>
<h3>Rigging Options</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have powered tilt and trim. Certainly a lighter engine 
option will make this easier.</p>
