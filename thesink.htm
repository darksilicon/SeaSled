<h1>The Sink</h1>
<p>Research</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ambassador Marine (makes lots of attractive options for yachts in 
  stainless steel at good prices.)</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>So I explored a few options with regards to the sink. the first on e was a 
metal one from ambassador marine. this would need soundproofing and padding and 
some other rather exotic features. also the mounting to the boat was suspect 
with regards to the vibration. Typically when it comes to things on boats the 
smaller you go in size (19feet in this case) you tend to need more robust less 
residential materials because the metal sink would probably vibrate and come un 
mounting and be difficult to seal and this could affect the minimal plumbing. so 
i figured it was better to just go a different route.</p>

<p>I have always liked the idea of molded fiberglass. You make you mould and out 
pops a perfectly suitable and usable product that you largely didn't have to do 
any work to get it looking good. All the work goes into the initial mold.</p>
<p>The first step was building a wooden mold. Then I used tooling Gel coat to 
laminate the fiberglass matting to the wood.</p>
