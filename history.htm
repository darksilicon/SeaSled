<h3>June 2022</h3>
<p>I decided to start on this project roughly around June 1st of 2022. I started 
by lofting the frames in my garage and then taking them to an outdoor space and 
assembling them on some sawhorses.</p>
<h3>July 2022</h3>
<p>By this point i had quite a bit of the plywood laminated to the frames and 
more had been done.</p>
<h3>August 2022</h3>
<p>By this point I cant really remember what i was working on but i am sure that 
it was important somehow.</p>
<h3>September 2022</h3>
<p>

the end of September 2022 The boat was on the ground in the garage and i was 
framing in the ribs. I originally was exploring the idea of mounting the 
electric grill up against the side of the boat. So that's what you see framed 
out here. I certainly was overly ambitious here and underestimated the time an 
effort it would take to get the boat planked with 3/8&quot; plywood everywhere. I was 
working with the framing here in the beginning of the month photo</p>

<h3><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">October 2022</span></h3>
<p>So this is what happened in October. I clearly didnt plan this layout very 
well... I need to work out Csss or something. I guess i could break it down into 
multiple pages but why?</p>

	<h3>November 2022</h3>
	<p>By the end of November 2022 I managed to get the other side of the bow 
	planking on albeit without any fiberglass</p>
