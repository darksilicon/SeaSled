<p>I guess that the helm layout could consist of not only the various 
electronical devices and displays but also what is behind the scenes, the 
furniture layout etc. some upholstery will be involved and generally its where a 
lot of things converge.</p>
<h3>Sightlines</h3>
<p>One of the goals for the helm is to have clear and easy sightlines for 
driving the boat while it is raining. Some of these older cabin cruiser designs 
had a raised platform in the back for the helmsman and it wouldnt be as 
protected from the rain but you can see clear advantages for clear weather.</p>
<h3>Equipment Locations</h3>
<p>Where will the various pieces of equipment be located? Should everything be 
deep in the cabin or located closer to the helm equipment? Where should fuses 
and easy access electrical stuff be located?</p>
<h3>Materials and waterproofing</h3>
<p>Some vinyl can be used on the dash but much of it will probably need to be 
wood or fiberglass a general mold might need to be created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Current Thoughts</h3>
<p>
<img border="0" src="Raymarine%20Logo.png" width="174" height="33" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">So 
far the helm is to be centered around the Raymarine<font face="Times New Roman">®</font> 
GPM400 System. I have selected a Nauticomp 15&quot; Display and that will take up 
most of the helm. I am starting to appreciate analog instruments and I may 
simply integrate more of those.</p>
