<h1>Sound System</h1>
<p>The Goal for the sound system is as follows...</p>
<h2>Speaker Selection</h2>
<p>According to ChatGPT these are the reasons to use Fusion FR-6022 in a boat 
cabin. It seems to track.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Water Resistance: Marine speakers need to withstand exposure to water, 
  moisture, and salt. The Fusion Marine FR-6022 speakers are typically built 
  with water-resistant materials, ensuring durability in marine conditions.</li>
  <li>Corrosion Resistance: The saltwater environment can be harsh on electronic 
  equipment. These speakers are often constructed with corrosion-resistant 
  materials to withstand the corrosive effects of saltwater.</li>
  <li>UV Resistance: Exposure to sunlight in open environments can cause 
  materials to degrade over time. Marine speakers are often UV-resistant to 
  protect them from the damaging effects of the sun.</li>
  <li>Quality Sound Output: Despite the challenging marine environment, these 
  speakers are engineered to deliver high-quality audio. This is important for 
  creating an enjoyable and immersive experience on a boat.</li>
  <li>Specifically Designed for Boats: The Fusion Marine FR-6022 speakers are 
  designed with the unique challenges of marine installations in mind. They may 
  have features such as a sealed design to prevent water intrusion and optimize 
  performance in confined spaces like boat cabins.</li>
  <li>Durability: Boats can experience vibrations, bumps, and other movements 
  that are not typical in a car or home setting. Marine speakers are often built 
  to be more robust and durable to handle these conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I have learned</h2>
<p>It seems that in the case of Marine speakers that I have looked into 
admittedly mostly the fusion ones. They seem to be tuned to a specific volume of 
sealed box. In the case of the 7.7&quot; main speakers that volume is approx. 30 
Liters.</p>
